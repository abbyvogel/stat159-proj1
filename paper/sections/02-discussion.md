*- What resources you used to get the job done?*

I used numerous tutorials on Professor Sanchez' Github repository to complete this project. First, I fully familiarized myself with make and makefiles through his tutorials. Additionally, I used google (specifically answers found on Stackoverflow) to clarify any questions that I had. Before this project, I was unsure of the true differences between Git and Github, and I did not realize that pandoc was created by a Berkeley professor until I read the wikipedia history of it.


*-What were the “easy” parts?*

Creating the file structure was simple and creating the makefile turned out to be very easy and intuitive. Especially practicing with the tutorials on dumby files, I gained understanding of the command structure quickly.

Initiallizing my Github repository and sharing it with the instructors was also painless. 


*-What were the challenging parts?*

I have always been someone who struggles to put my thoughts into words and this project was no exception. I had difficulty making sure that what I wrote about the different projects was accurate and was brief. As always, I could work harder on time-management and not leaving tasks to the last minute. 


*-What things you were stuck with?*

I didn't feel stuck with any component of this project. The instructions were very clear, and I understood where all the resources I had to deapen my understanding were throughout the whole project. 

I hope to be able to come back to these resources for future projects and even in my real world applications of reprocibility and collaboration.

*-What was the most time consuming part?*

Because I really wanted to understand GNU Make, I spent the most time going through the tutorials. Additionally, the discussion of the project and writing in markdown took additional time. 

*-Did you work with and/or get help from someone else? If yes, in what manner?*

I worked on this project completely independently. Working alone certainly helped eliminate any workflow issues, but it could have been nice to bounce ideas and trouble shoot with another person. Collaborative learning is really helpful to me, and explaining concepts to other people is one way that I really formalize my understanding of a topic. 

*-How much time did it take?*

This project took about 4 or 5 hours combined over a few days.
